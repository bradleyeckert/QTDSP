Consciousness can be considered a physical process occurring inside and outside of time simultaneously,
per spiritual traditions and modern QM theory (in its Bohmian interpretation),
using two-dimensional time.
In this model, quantum time emerges from non-local consciousness as it interacts with both worlds.
The relationship between the time dimensions provides a mechanism for apparent
noise arising from both our biological signaling and connection to a timeless divinity.
Algorithms are proposed for the demodulation of ubiquitous white and pink noise,
which could have hidden information content that instruments the
mind-body landscape and the interaction of eternal consciousness with the physical world.
This is key to solving the most pressing problem of our time, which is
``the totalitarian psychosis'' described by Carl G. Jung, or \emph{wetiko} as it's known
to indigenous peoples.
