\section{Summary}

Signals that appear to be pure noise may contain hidden signals regarding non-local consciousness.
These signals could be analyzed to ``instrument the soul''.
Follow-up work to be done includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Add features to the QTSA app to facilitate signal identification.
	\item Analyze existing experimental data to search for new signals.
	\item Develop new sensor technologies using quantum and spin effects.
\end{itemize}

The social impetus for such work is to repair the dysfunction introduced by
new technologies such as social media and pseudo-anonymous communications.
Instrumenting the soul would provide a new way of interacting that is completely open and honest.
Solving the trust problem would be a boon to economies across the globe.
